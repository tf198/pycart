PyCart
======

A web interface for your git repositories.  Aims to be a quick drop in
replacement for Trac + Git.  Much of the design blatently borrowed from
`GitHub` until I have time to work out something better :)

Renderers
=========

The following renders are supported if the modules are installed:

* Markdown ``pip install markdown``
* ReSTructured text ``pip install docutils``
